#random is like a car, one person cannot build the whole car, so each part is assigned to a person like tire module, engine module etc
#when a system is built and the code is large and long it is split into module
#below the module.py is imported
import my_module

num = random.randint(1,10) #randint gives num between 1 and 10 inclusive
