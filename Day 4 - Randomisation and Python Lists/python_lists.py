#lists are datastructures, which is a way of organisaing and storing data in python
#unlike variables, this allows to group information
#eg: storing names of the states_of_america of USA individually doesnt make sense, they belong together, becus they got a connection with eachother
#sometimes u will want order in your data

# numbers = [fw,2,r,a, True] <= a list is a mixture of data types, must have sqaure brackets

'''instead of 
state1 = montana 
state2 = pennsylvania..
'''
#list does below

states_of_america = ['Montana','Pennsylvania','sddd','ddd']

print(states_of_america[0]) #first position starts with 0
print(states_of_america[-1]) #use minus index to start from end of the list
print(states_of_america) #print the list

#add a new state at the end of the list
# states_of_america.append("Senara") 

#add a list of things at the end of the list
states_of_america.extend(["senara","lalala","dd"])
print(states_of_america)
